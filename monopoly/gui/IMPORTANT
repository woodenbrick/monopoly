//    In the constructor, we call setupUi() to initialize the form.
//    Thanks to multiple inheritance, we can access Ui::GoToCellDialog's members directly.
//            After creating the user interface, setupUi() will also automatically connect
//            any slots that follow the naming convention on_objectName_signalName() to
//            the corresponding objectName's signalName() signal. In our example, this
//            means that setupUi() will establish the following signalâ€“slot connection:
//
//    connect(lineEdit, SIGNAL(textChanged(const QString &)),
//            this, SLOT(on_lineEdit_textChanged()));
